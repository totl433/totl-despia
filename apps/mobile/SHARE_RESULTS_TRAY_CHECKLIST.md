# Share Results Tray Regression Checklist

Use this quick checklist after changes to fixtures-share UI.

- [ ] Open share tray from Home results pill (`fixturesShare` mode).
- [ ] Tray opens with visible top gap (app content still peeks above tray).
- [ ] `X` closes tray and returns to previous screen cleanly.
- [ ] Drag down from tray handle closes tray.
- [ ] Tap dimmed backdrop above tray closes tray.
- [ ] Share action row stays fixed at bottom (`Insta`, `WhatsApp`, `More`).
- [ ] Share preview card remains centered and fully visible.
- [ ] Exported shared image is full quality and not cropped.
- [ ] iOS simulator: no crash/warning when closing repeatedly.
