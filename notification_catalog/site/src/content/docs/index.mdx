## Key Features

- **Idempotency**: Every notification has a deterministic `event_id` to prevent duplicates
- **Preference Enforcement**: All user preferences are enforced server-side
- **Grouping**: OneSignal `collapse_id`, `thread_id`, and `android_group` are set on every push
- **Audit Log**: Every send attempt is logged in `notification_send_log`
- **Cooldowns**: Per-user cooldowns prevent notification spam
